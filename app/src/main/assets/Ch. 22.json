But some authorities say that there are twenty-six elements, while others cite twenty-five or else seven, nine, six, four or eleven, and even others say that there are seventeen, sixteen or thirteen."

All such philosophers spoke under the shelter of my mystic potency, and thus they could say anything without contradicting the truth."

         "text":"22.8: All subtle material elements are actually present within their gross effects; similarly, all gross elements are present within their subtle causes, since material creation takes place by progressive manifestation of elements from subtle to gross. Thus we can find all material elements within any single element."

         "text":"22.9: Therefore, no matter which of these thinkers is speaking, and regardless of whether in their calculations they include material elements within their previous subtle causes or else within their subsequent manifest products, I accept their conclusions as authoritative, because a logical explanation can always be given for each of the different theories."

These modes — goodness, passion and ignorance — are the effective causes of the creation, maintenance and destruction of this universe."

Time is perceived as the agitated interaction of the material modes, and the totality of functional propensity is embodied by the primeval sutra, or mahat-tattva."

The Lord does not enter the interaction of material manifestation but merely glances on nature."

      {
         "text":"22.18: As the material elements, headed by the mahat-tattva, are transformed, they receive their specific potencies from the glance of the Supreme Lord, and being amalgamated by the power of nature, they create the universal egg."

According to this theory, the body, senses, life air and all material phenomena are produced from these seven elements."

Consequently, the mind appears to come into being and to suffer annihilation along with its objects of perception, and thus its ability to distinguish past and future is lost."

This total forgetfulness of one's previous material identity, which comes about for one reason or another, is called death."

As one observes a flowing river, ever-new water passes by and goes far away, yet a foolish person, observing one point in the river, falsely states, 'This is the water of the river.' Similarly, although the material body of a human being is constantly undergoing transformation, those who are simply wasting their lives falsely think and say that each particular stage of the body is the person's real identity"
