It is with dhyana we do everything. With that awareness we are acting in this world. Depth and intensity of awareness. Sorrow is there because that constant simran is not there of our essential nature. The jewel of happiness is within us. Get aware."

The previous notions/habits cause distinctions and differences thereby causing incompleteness. Then we gain desires to complete our selves. Recognise that there is only one infinite reality and that reality alone pervades the world of names and forms. Surrender. Verse 7.19."

I love the entire body/3 gunas with its different parts. Next step, vasnas/impressions/vrittis stop us from being in oneness. So meditation removes these conditionings. (Modus operandi of RamKrishna paramhamsa). Chapter 6."

In modern management, the more dissatisfied you are, greater is your achievement. This is wrong. Self effort done with attitude of humility that I am not the doer, its His grace and accepts whatever prasada is given to him with humility and satisfaction, this is initial preparation for meditation - called karma yoga/devotional service in Geeta. Dedicated activity with humility and surrender which gives a sense of satisfaction"

Great meditator like Shiva smear ashes on body which shows that shiv ji has burnt down his ignorance, imperfections, desires, lust, passion, seeds of vasans/past impressions to ashes. Seeds are burnt down to ashes. The true glory of a man is that he is no longer a victim of his mind and his desires. Liberated."

Then mind dissolves into that indescribable and what remains is that pure, unconditional truth."

Contemplation is not merely thinking, feeling, it is holding our mind steadily towards our object of contemplation without any other thought in our mind. It is not a single thought but the same species/series of thoughts all directed/dovetailed towards that one object of contemplation. This is shaguna dhyana.
